    * - Relative pattern with `/`: matched against path relative to the filesystem root.
    *   `secrets/keys` matches `<root>/secrets/keys`; `**​/secrets` matches at any depth.
    * - Glob characters `*`, `?`, `[…]` are supported in all cases.
    *   `*` matches within a single component; `**` matches zero or more directories.
    * - A path is classified if it matches the pattern OR is a descendant of a match.
    * - Trailing `/` is stripped (no directory-only distinction).
